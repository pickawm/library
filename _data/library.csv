I hope you will find time to enjoy looking at these eloquent faces and places captured by photographers whose vision, unwittingly at the time, you shared.  But I'm so glad that your blessedly inescapable and wonderfully developed gift led you to chose literature over the lens; and my gratitude to you, which goes very deep, is always, always and mostly, for your beautiful fiction.  It has formed for me, for most of my adult life (this is also the 20th anniversary of my book on your fiction!), ""a vision shared"" - of life itself - a way of seeing, valuing, growing, suffering through, delighting in, and loving it! / Denotedly, / Ruth"" Note: A collection of photos. taken by the photographers of the U.S. Farm Security Administration.",Mississippi Department of Archives and History,W2005.1.1709,image/jpg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

Woodburn indicated, too, that his firm would like to publish Eudora’s seventeen early stories in a volume eventually entitled A Curtain of Green. A contract was offered to Eudora in late January 1941 with a publication date set for November 7, 1941 (Polk 441–44). On October 23, 1942, Doubleday, Doran published The Robber Bridegroom, likewise edited by Woodburn (Polk 446).

I am forever grateful for her and them. / If you do not have this book, the / writer of the ‘Optimist’s Daughter’ / should! Hearing you read your / work in person has made all / of it more so. Helen cried / when I gave her new / book of snapshots / It gives me confidence / to continue / without / technique” Note: Facsim. ed. of original ms. dated August 8th, 1913, and signed F.W.L.
